Project Brief: Authentication System using Express.js

I developed a secure authentication system using Express.js that handles user registration, login, and protected route access. The backend follows a RESTful architecture and uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for stateless authentication.

Users can sign up with encrypted passwords using bcrypt, and upon successful login, a JWT token is generated and sent to the client. This token is then used to authorize protected APIs through middleware.

The project includes:

User registration & login APIs

Password hashing and validation

JWT-based authentication & authorization

Protected routes using auth middleware

Proper error handling and response structure

This project helped me understand backend security, middleware flow, token-based authentication, and real-world API design using Express.
